# BackBond #

BackBond is the backend API used in
Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates Visualizer.

This was made for a project in collaboration
with a friend and my dad.

## Context ##

My dad loves to check the "Daily Treasury Par yield Curve
Rates" every day on his phone, which can be found [here](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve).

One day when he was explaining to me the significance
of the data. He mentioned how if I could plot this
interest rate data on a graph, we could potentially
predict when the next [bear market](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/bear-market#:~:text=A%20time%20when%20stock%20prices,least%20a%20two%2Dmonth%20period.)
will hit. During a bear market, everything is at its cheapest
buying point, meaning it is a great time to buy
low sell high. 

My role in this mini-project was to create a RESTful API
that will relay data to the frontend webpage where the
data is going to be displayed for my dad to see on a graph.
