# BackBond 

This application presists government interest data and allows a client to query it through the provided endpoints.

## Context

I created this application because my dad would view the government interest rate data from the government ran website [here](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve), and by taking one look you can probably tell that it is not very insightful. This sparked the creation for BackBond which works hand in hand with the frontend, *FrontBond*, which provides an easy to use interface to visualizing the government interest rate data in a pretty way.
